Project "YOUR MONEY TODAY"
<br>
The "YOUR MONEY TODAY" project aims to explore and learn more about JavaScript, focusing on creating a web application that displays updated exchange rates for the US Dollar, Euro, Angolan Kwanza, and Argentine Peso in relation to the Brazilian Real (BRL).

To achieve this, we are developing an API using Node.js and Express.js to fetch these exchange rates in real-time.

This project is not only about the technical implementation of the API but also about continuous learning of JavaScript, RESTful APIs, and integrating web services into modern applications.
